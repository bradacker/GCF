If you are a hiker, then you know the importance of good camping meals. Walking for hours each day requires more calories than most people need when <a title="Dutch Oven Recipes for Camping" href="http://goodcampingfood.com/dutch-oven-recipes-for-camping/" target="_blank">camping outdoors</a>. The calories need to be both high in carbohydrates and protein for maximum energy. A camping recipes dinner for the hiker needs to consist of dry foods that can be mixed and cooked on simple canister stoves.

If you have yet to cook outdoors on a hiking trip, you need to try it. Good camping meals means hot food and this is a heavenly experience for a hiker.

This is just over a quart and will be large enough to cook several camping recipes dinner for yourself or for two people if you are hiking with a friend.

Canister stoves are the best choice for a hiker. They are lightweight and the fuel is inexpensive. MSR makes the Pocket Rocket Stove that can boil a quart of water in less than four minutes. It can easily cook with the 1.1 liter pot from MSR.

One of the best camping recipes dinner for the hiker is a high energy oatmeal mix. This mix can be made in the outdoors with ingredients stored in plastic bags or it can be mixed ahead of time and brought with you in one ready to cook bag. Good camping meals always center around light weight dry ingredients.

Start with a cup of oatmeal and mix one fourth a cup of powdered milk. Add to this one third cup of raisins and a third cup of your favorite nuts. This can be a mixture of your favorite or simply one nut such as almonds. Make sure you nuts are unsalted for this recipe.
