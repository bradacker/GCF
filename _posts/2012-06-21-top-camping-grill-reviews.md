It can be a lot of information to sort through. We break down what you need to look for and picked out the top three camping grills to give you an easy start to finding the one that suites you best.

## Important Points to Consider in Camping Grills:

The camping gas grills work on Propane gas and can be easily transported and used with standard propane tanks for an event, camping or picnic. You can buy a reasonably good camping gas grill in a price range of $ 150 and $ 500.

The size of the grill and the features will be determined based on the type of food cooked and the number of people you want to serve. A smaller grill can be quite useful for making a few hot dogs, burgers and some vegetables. However, if you need to cook big heaps of food, a large grill will be the right choice.

These grills have multiple features, but an expert can use a basic grill to cook a variety of stuff. The three main primary parts of the portable grill include its burners, heat distribution plates and the cooking grates. You can go for additional features, if it is essential.

The amount of heat from the burner and the area of cooking surface is important. The body of a grill is normally fabricated with aluminum, steel, cast iron, stainless steel. A grill with a durable cover will last longer. You need to carry an extra filled cylinder as a stand by.
