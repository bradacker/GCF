## What to Take Camping

Going on a family camping can certainly be a fun an exciting experience, whether you have been on one with your family before or not. However, there are some basic things that you are going to want to remember to bring with you so that you can all enjoy your <a title="Good Camping Meals for Hikers" href="http://goodcampingfood.com/good-camping-meals-for-hikers/" target="_blank">camping trip</a> to the fullest extent.

After all, forgetting to bring essential camping supplies with you on your trip can be a recipe for disaster, so it is always a good idea to make a quick check list of what to take camping so that you can ensure that nothing is left behind or forgotten.

So one common question that a lot of people have is what to pack for camping? Well, that will depend on a few different factors, such as how long you are going to be gone, what the weather is going to be like, and where, exactly, you are camping.

## Camping Supplies

If you are going to be staying in a tent, then of course you are going to want to make sure that you have a sturdy tent that is large enough for your entire family.Â Coleman is a popular brand of camping supplies that makes tents to sleep anywhere from one person to eight or more. So depending on the size of your family, it is a good idea to have a tent large enough to sleep all of them and then some. Typically, you can find a four person tent for under $75.

Aside from the obvious tent, when it comes to what to take camping, it is important to focus on <a title="Dutch Oven Recipes for Camping" href="http://goodcampingfood.com/dutch-oven-recipes-for-camping/" target="_blank">food</a> and drink supplies that are good for family camping trips.

If you plan to be gathering around a campfire at any point during your trip, which most families enjoy at some point, then you will want to make sure you have plenty of snacks and supplies to make s&#8217;mores. These are a staple of camping trips, and so you will want to make sure that you have graham crackers, Hershey&#8217;s chocolate and marshmallows so that you can roast them on the open fire. These only cost a few bucks but can be a great and memorable experience for anyone who goes camping.

Another thing to consider when it comes to family camping supplies and what to take camping is to bring either a portable grill or at least some charcoal, if your campsite has grills available for use. For a portable grill, these typically run close to $100 or more, depending on the size.

To cook for a family of four, a Coleman portable grill would be a great purchase. These are perfect for making hot dogs or hamburgers out on the barbecue, and will be useful on any camping trip in the future.

Overall, remembering what to take camping can be difficult, and there are more supplies not listed here that you will want to keep in mind, such as bringing plenty of water and perhaps a first aid kit as well.

However, keeping a list of these supplies is a sure fire way to make sure that you don&#8217;t forget anything. Have fun!
