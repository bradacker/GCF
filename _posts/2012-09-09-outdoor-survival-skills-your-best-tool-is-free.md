Your greatest tool for survival is your mind.

Being lost in the great outdoors is a mental challenge. You&#8217;ll feel lost, scared, frustrated, and confused. You&#8217;ll think short term and hope you get found. Then you&#8217;ll panic. But, that might not happen to you because if you&#8217;re reading this I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;re preparing yourself properly.

### What should you do to prevent this mental breakdown?

Breathe deeply and let you mind become clear and then focus on what you need to do. If you are in a panic, you won&#8217;t be able to think clearly. Luckily, the outdoors provides a great environment for clearing your mind of negative thoughts. Calming sounds and fresh air. Do your best to avoid becoming overwhelmed. After you&#8217;ve relaxed your mind, you need to come up with a strategic plan of action.

## Strategic Planning Process

Determine what tools or resources you have to work with. Maybe you carry an emergency fire starter<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodcampingfood-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0010O748Q" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> on your keychain or have a lighter in your pocket. Check all your pockets, backpack or bag, first aid kit and anything else you might have with you. Think outside the box and most items can be useful in different ways then there original purpose. If you&#8217;ve ever watched any survival shows you know what I&#8217;m taking about.

You can take what you&#8217;ve learned by watching survival shows and reading books and imply these to your strategic planning.

At this point you can&#8217;t afford to waste any energy. Try not to over think the situation. Each task has to be essential to your survival. After you&#8217;ve gathered your thoughts, consider the following items when assessing the situation:

  * Water
  * Shelter
  * <a title="Best Camping Food Ideas on Earth" href="http://goodcampingfood.com/best-camping-food-ideas-on-earth/" target="_blank">Food</a>
  * Direction

Now is the time to take action. Don&#8217;t make the survival situation more complicated then it has to be.

Each scenario planning technique will be different depending on many factors, such as location, resources, weather and lots more.

If you remember the core survival elements in all your strategic planning, you&#8217;ll be fine. Prioritize what you need to survive.

For example, is it late at night and you&#8217;re tired? You&#8217;ll need to find shelter for a place to sleep. Look for caves, overhangs and other natural shelters mother nature might provide. This will make the effort for shelter a lot easier and you&#8217;ll conserve energy. Make sure you get enough sleep to stay at max mental capacity.

Whatever your situation, make a mental to-do list and take action.

## Make Fire

If you know how to make a fire with a stick or have gear that will assist you in making one, I highly suggest you do. This will not only provide you heat and protection from dangerous animals, but it will give you a big mental boost of positive energy. This will be a huge step in the right direction for your health.

Let&#8217;s not forget you can use the fire to make smoke signals for help or just plan smoke will usually do the trick. If you have any rubber or something else that will create a darker smoke, use it. More benefits of fires include cooking, melting ice and boiling water. You&#8217;ll always want to boil water to kill any parasites.

Just a fire and water alone can create such an environment, that you might even forget you&#8217;re in difficult situations.

## Staying Hydrated

Water is essential to everyones survival. Staying well hydrated will increase your mental capacity and strengthen you body. Always have water with you. Do not wait until you are totally out of water to start searching for more. Keep a good amount with you and find water sources as soon as possible.



Keep a positive attitude, your thoughts clear and productive. These are absolutely key to your survival survival situation. Take your outdoor survival skills and knowledge and put them to use. Keep your mind at peak performance, take action and survive.
