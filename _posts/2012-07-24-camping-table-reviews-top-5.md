If you are in the market for a good camping table, you&#8217;ve come to the right place. I&#8217;ve thoroughly researched the top camping tables online and came up with the top 5.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" alt="Camping Table" src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1099/1443923194_5c8be5ba27.jpg" width="500" height="336" />
</p>

These tables can also be used for the backyard BBQ, at a tailgate party, buffet service, RV’ing, the beach or anywhere else tables are used.

**1. Coleman Pack-Away 4-In-1 Table**

If you are looking for versatility, then this is your table. It&#8217;s also well made, as is any Coleman product. Also easy to transport and store.

The 4 in 1 options include two tables separately, place end-to-end to create a long buffet table, or side-by-side for classic square dining table. The legs are also adjustable to set the height (low, medium, high).

  * Each table&#8217;s surface measures 31.5 by 15.5 inches (W x D)
  * Folds down to 24 by three by 16 inches (W x H X D)
  * Height adjustable at 14.5, 27.5, 31.5 inches

Cons:** **This was good insight from B. Becker on Amazon:

> One of the pictures in the description of the table in use as a buffet is an accident waiting to happen. If you were to use it in that manner, I&#8217;d suggest setting it up against a wall to keep anyone from bumping it and send it toppling over.

**2. RIO Adventure Centerfold Table**

One feature that you won&#8217;t find in the #1 table is that this table has a heat-resistant tabletop up to 425 degrees. This table is also sturdy, lightweight, easy to carry and store. Other than camping, this table could be used for RV&#8217;ing, tailgating, backyard BBQs, and more.

Cons: The only complaint I could find is that people thought the table would be larger. Please pay attention to the dimensions, as this is a 4&#8217;x2&#8242; table (Measures 48” x 24” x 27” when open. Folds to 24” x 24” x 3”).

**3. Ultra Lightweight Premium Folding Aluminum Camping Table with Cup Holders and Umbrella Hole!**

This is a little different then a normal camping table but that&#8217;s what makes it great. It reminds me of a &#8220;kids table.&#8221; I&#8217;m picturing the adults taking the picnic table and the kids on this one. Okay, back to reality.

  * Open Size: 21&#8243; L x 21&#8243; W x 16&#8243; H
  * Folded Size: 5&#8243; L x 5&#8243; W x 25&#8243; H

The good is that it&#8217;s extremely compact, has cupholders (umbrella hole too!), and is waterproof and mildew resistant. The black fabric always helps with covering up spots. This table fits into a carrying bag like the fold up chairs, so it&#8217;s super easy to carry and store. This table would be awesome for the beach.

The bad is that I couldn&#8217;t find anything bad about it. All the reviews were 5 stars. It seems that if you know what you are getting with this table, then this is perfect.

**4. Stansport Picnic Table and Umbrella Combo Pack, Green**

Wow, this table looks really cool. This is on the opposite spectrum from #3, as this can fit four adults. But, after reading the reviews this seems to be another &#8220;kids table&#8221; as the materials don&#8217;t seem to hold up with adults.

Table top dimensions: 33 by 25 by 16 inches (L x W x H). This is still a little on the small side. It is also lightweight and super convenient.

I found out that it needs to be used on a flat hard surface as the legs will bend and break if it isn&#8217;t.

Overall, if you are looking for a kids table that will be used on a flat hard surface, this seems to be a great choice.

**5. Lifetime 22315 37-Inch Square Folding Table with 37-Inch Square Molded Top, White Granite**

This is your standard folding table or card table. This table will last a long time, as it has a 10 year warranty. These tables are also extremely easy to clean. It&#8217;s a fairly good size, with a 37&#8221; x 37&#8221; table top.

Cons: It looks like a few people had problems with screws and the legs. Apparently, some tables seem to slip by quality control and end up in these homes. If this happens to you, I would just return it (which Amazon will accept).

&#8212;

In conclusion, you can definitely see that the top two stand out in a class of their own. If you are looking for a kids camping table, three and four are good choices. If you want to play it safe with the standard card table, then number five is the way to go.
