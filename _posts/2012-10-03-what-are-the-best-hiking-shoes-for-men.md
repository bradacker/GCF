This is a review of the top three hiking shoes. If you are having a hard time determining what hiking shoes you should buy and what to look for, you&#8217;ve come the the right place. Not only will we point out the positives, we&#8217;ll let you know the negatives.

Determining factors that were taken into consideration were:

  * 4 star rating or better
  * Over 20 reviews
  * New and bestselling status

## Coming in at number 1: Merrell Men&#8217;s &#8216;Moab Ventilator&#8217; Lace-up Hiking Shoes<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodcampingfood-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004I9X420" width="1" height="1" border="0" />

If you don&#8217;t like the look of these shoes, I highly suggest you take a look at the options of colors available. With over 100 reviews and 4.5 stars average, this shoe has out done itself.

### Pros:

  * Leather and mesh &#8211; a great combination of stability and breathability.
  * Merrell brand &#8211; high quality product with a great reputation in the outdoor retail space.
  * Light weight and comfortable shoe, perfect for short or long hikes.

### Cons:

  * Some people say the shoes run small. If you&#8217;re on the edge of a shoe size, go for the size up.

## Coming in at number 2: Teva Men&#8217;s Raith eVent Waterproof Hiking Shoe<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodcampingfood-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0055ATVVE" width="1" height="1" border="0" />

## Pros:

  * If you&#8217;re looking for a _waterproof hiking shoe_, this shoe has been known to keep people&#8217;s feet dry through snow and water.
  * Interior cushion is great for hiking trips or all day hikes.
  * Quality shoe that not only fits the bill and takes care of business on the trail, but it looks nice as well.

## Cons:

  * Color appears to be darker in person from the picture shown.
  * The tongue might be too short for your taste as you can see in the picture.

## Last but not least, coming in at number 3: Merrell Men&#8217;s Moab Waterproof Lace-Up Shoes<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodcampingfood-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001G0MPEC" width="1" height="1" border="0" />

## Pros:

  * Waterproof, so if you work outside or have unexpected weather when you&#8217;re hiking you&#8217;ll be set.
  * The Merrell brand name is always a plus. Top quality shoe that is comfortable.

## Cons:

  * Some complained the size is too small. Once again if you&#8217;re on the edge of a size with Merrell, you might want to buy a size above. I find them to fit like any other shoe.
  * Some said the shoe didn&#8217;t hold up or the waterproofing wasn&#8217;t up to there standards. This was only a small percentage of the reviews, as most reviews were 5 stars.

### I sincerely hope these reviews help you decide which hiking shoe is right for you.
