If you are the type of person who likes to enjoy the great outdoors through going backpacking or hiking, then there is a good chance that you already have a few <a title="Dutch Oven Recipes for Camping" href="http://goodcampingfood.com/dutch-oven-recipes-for-camping/" target="_blank">different meals</a> and snacks that you rely on to power you through your treks. After all, it is important to have the right food and nutrients when you are backpacking or hiking, as your energy can drain quickly otherwise.

However, a lot of times, people think that staying full and energized on a hike means having to sacrifice <a title="Good Camping Meals for Hikers" href="http://goodcampingfood.com/good-camping-meals-for-hikers/" target="_blank">great tasting food</a>, but the truth is that this does not have to be the case. In fact, there are all kinds of flavorful backpacking recipes that you should consider giving a try the next time you are out on the trail.

If you are an early morning backpacker, then it is a good idea to have a great breakfast recipe to rely on. What better breakfast food to enjoy than some hot pancakes? You might actually be surprised at just how easy (and mess-free) it can be to make these. All you will need in order to make these delicious pancakes is a pan, a spatula, a source to start a small fire, some Biscuit mix (usually about a cup is enough for one person), one cup of dry milk, a tablespoon of sugar, a cup of water and a tablespoon butter (it is probably best to use squeezable butter, rather than worrying about it melting in your bag). You can mix all of these ingredients together into a bag before you hit the trail.

Start with a fire and set the pan on top of it to heat. Once the pan is hot, add the mix by cutting a small hole in the bag to pour it out gradually. Flip with a spatula until they are golden brown and enjoy! You can even bring some maple syrup if you want to add more flavor, but these will be sure to power you through your hike.

If you are looking for more of a midday <a title="Best Hiking and Backpacking Food Ideas" href="http://goodcampingfood.com/best-hiking-backpacking-food-ideas/" target="_blank">meal for backpacking</a> later in the day, how does chicken quinoa sound? This might sound fancy and difficult to make on the trail, but it doesn&#8217;t need to be. All you need for this is a large pot, half cup of quinoa, a tablespoon of chives, a fourt of a teaspoon each of cumin and coriander, paprika, and three ounces of uncooked chicken. At home, before the hike, mix everything together in a bag except for the chicken.

On the trail, build a small fire and use a pot to bring a cup of water to a boil before adding everything from the bag to the mix. Next, add the chicken and heat until cooked all the way through. Enjoy!

Overall, backpacking is a rigorous activity, but that does not mean you should not still be able to enjoy some great, energy-restoring and delicious meals away from home. So be sure to keep these great backpacking recipes in mind the next time you go!
