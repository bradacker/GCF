Baked potatoes (wrap in tinfoil, and bury under the campfire coals takes about 30 minutes ish and they&#8217;re done.

Roasted garlic -cut off top of garlic and pour on a little bit of olive oil, wrap in tin foil and bury in the camp fire for about 25 minutes ish&#8230; and spread on bread or whatever.

Spear a red pepper and hold over a campfire til the outside gets nicely charred &#8211; stick in a paper bag for about 20 mnutes and then peel off the charred layer &#8211; enjoy fresh roasted peppers also works with italian peppers, yellow peppers and green peppers but red are the sweetest.

Shish kebobs &#8211; spear chicken chunks (that you&#8217;ve marinated in italian dressing in a ziplock baggie) with some veggie chunks over the open fire.

I&#8217;ve just decided, that Vodka makes everything better&#8230; (Working on _camping_ _food_ menu)
